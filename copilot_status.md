# Copilot Status

## Current Tasks

### May 5, 2025
- Implementing email reasoning tests for embedded conditional blocks
- Added functionality to detect and process if/then conditional instructions in emails
- Created test cases for conditional email reasoning scenarios
- Fixed bug in condition detection logic to properly recognize various phrasings
- Merged completed calendar reservation locking mechanics tests into the main branch
- Created comprehensive test suite for calendar agent's locking mechanisms
- Resolved merge conflicts during integration with main branch
- Updated documentation to reflect the completed work

### May 4, 2025
- Fixed calendar reasoning tests to handle different date formats (YYYY/MM/DD and YYYY-MM-DD)
- Fixed failing email reasoning tests by improving mock implementation
- Ensured all tests pass consistently
- Created documentation in TASK-003.md for the fixes implemented
- Verified application functionality continues to work as expected

## Completed Tasks

### May 5, 2025
- ✓ t110-calendar-reasoning → Implemented calendar agent reservation locking tests
- Completed test suite for calendar double-agent scheduling collision
- Successfully verified that the calendar agent correctly handles concurrent operations
- Added automated lock expiration and conflict resolution tests

### April 27, 2025
- Initial project setup
- Identified test failures in calendar and email reasoning tests
- Analyzed mock implementations for inconsistencies

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of the next task: "expand reasoning tests for email agent"
- Focus on testing edge cases in email parsing, especially for conditional instructions
- Review other potential edge cases in agent implementations
- Improve error handling in the main application for date format inconsistencies
