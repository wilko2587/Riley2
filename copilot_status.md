# ðŸ¤– Copilot Status

<!-- This file tracks the current status of tasks being worked on by GitHub Copilot -->

## Current Session: May 3, 2025

### Task Focus
Working on `highlevel.verify_email_calendar` with specific attention to:
- `checkpoint.test_email_agent` (in progress)
- âœ… `lowlevel.compare_email_mock_vs_real` (completed)
- âœ… `lowlevel.test_email_edge_cases` (completed)

### Current Activity
- [x] Initialize development environment
- [x] Review project structure and documentation
- [x] Examine email agent implementation
- [x] Compare real and mock email agent implementations
- [x] Review test_email_agent_compatibility.py implementation
- [x] Validate tests using VS Code Testing Explorer
- [x] Update documentation and status files
- [x] Create test_email_agent_edge_cases.py with 8 comprehensive tests
- [x] Enhance error handling in EmailAgentMock
- [x] Improve authentication error handling in email_download_chunk
- [x] Run tests and verify all tests pass

### Status
ðŸŸ© COMPLETED: Successfully validated the compatibility between real and mock email agent implementations. The test_email_agent_compatibility.py file contains comprehensive tests that verify function existence, signature compatibility, and output format consistency between implementations. Despite structural differences (class-based mock vs standalone functions in real implementation), the interfaces are compatible and can be used interchangeably.

ðŸŸ© COMPLETED: Successfully implemented and validated edge case handling for email agent. The test_email_agent_edge_cases.py file contains 8 comprehensive tests covering failure handling, retries, and malformed inputs. Enhancements were made to error handling in EmailAgentMock and authentication error handling in email_download_chunk. All tests passed successfully.

### Next Steps
- Move on to `highlevel.verify_email_calendar` task
- Implement calendar integration tests
