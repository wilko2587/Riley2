  [COP]  Structure now includes: /agents, /interfaces, /logs, /tests, /releases

    > STATE: [[32mDONE[0m]]         make folders for agents and logs
      SPEC:  Create folders where code and logs will live.
      [COP]  issue: #str001
      [COP]  committed [x], pushed [x]
      [GPT]  This keeps runtime logic separate from system output.

    > STATE: [[32mDONE[0m]]         add folders for testing and release notes
      SPEC:  Helps track quality and changes over time.
      [COP]  issue: #str002
      [COP]  committed [x], pushed [x]
      [COP]  Folder structure fully matches what we use in the roadmap and protocol.

  [PENDING] checkpoint complete unless reviewed
  [MERGE] confirmed by GPT

> STATE: [[36mMERGE[0m]]        create a way to run the system
  SPEC:  Set up a file that can start the system from the command line.
  [COP]  branch opened: t002-entrypoint
  [COP]  branch t002-entrypoint merged
  [COP]  branch t002-entrypoint deleted
  [GPT]  This allows the system to run in tests or in live mode with one command.

    > STATE: [[32mDONE[0m]]         add main file to launch system
      SPEC:  This is the file the developer or agent runs first.
      [COP]  issue: #cli001
      [COP]  committed [x], pushed [x]
      [COP]  main.py runs agents, logs events, and supports test mode.

    > STATE: [[32mDONE[0m]]         support basic settings and text output
      SPEC:  Print out startup info and accept future options.
      [COP]  issue: #cli002
      [COP]  committed [x], pushed [x]
      [GPT]  Prepares the system for environment flags and status feedback.
