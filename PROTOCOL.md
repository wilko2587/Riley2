# üö¶ Riley2 Protocols

This file defines how autonomous agents and humans interact with the Riley2 framework. It governs task execution, logging, testing, committing, and releasing.

---

## üîÅ Task Execution Flow

### 1. On Startup
- Read `README.md` to understand system architecture
- Read `ROADMAP.md` and locate next actionable `[ ] TASK-###`
- Cross-reference `GPTLOG.md` to avoid duplicate or blocked work
- Begin tracking in `copilot_status.md`

### 2. While Working
- Log substep activity in real-time to `copilot_status.md`
- Leave `#TODO`, `#FIXME`, `#NOTE` in code as needed
- Use VSCode **Testing Explorer** to run all tests
- Fix failures until all pass ‚Äî do **not** rollback unless explicitly told

### 2.1. On Starting a Task
When beginning work on a task, checkpoint, or low-level item:
- Update status to `in-progress` in `ROADMAP.md` 
- Format in-progress items with **bold text** in `ROADMAP.md`
- Begin tracking progress in `copilot_status.md`
- Make an initial entry in `GPTLOG.md` indicating the task has started
- Create a new branch named `task/TASK-###` if working on a new TASK
- **Important:** Highlight the task you are currently working on with amber color in ROADMAP.md using:
  `<span style="color:#FFA500">lowlevel.task_name status: in-progress</span>`
- This amber highlighting must be applied to the entire line of the task being worked on

### 3. On Completion (`‚úÖ PASS`)
- **Important:** Remove any amber highlighting from ROADMAP.md before committing
- Mark `[x]` in `ROADMAP.md` next to the task
- Append a `GPTLOG.md` entry
- Generate a release note in `releases/TASK-###.md`
- Commit using format: `TASK-###: <summary>`
- Push changes to the remote repository using `git push origin task/TASK-###`
- Never leave committed changes unpushed

### 3.1. On Low-Level Task Completion
When completing a low-level task (`lowlevel.*`) within a larger checkpoint or high-level goal:
- Update status to `completed` in `ROADMAP.md`
- Format completed items with ~~strikethrough~~ in `ROADMAP.md`
- Append the completion to the current task's entry in `GPTLOG.md`
- Create or update release notes in `releases/TASK-###.md` with completed work
- Add a commit identifier that references the task (e.g., "TASK-002: Completed lowlevel.compare_email_mock_vs_real")
- Commit and push the changes using the same identifier
- Always push changes to the remote repository after committing

### 4. On Failure (`‚ùå FAIL` or `‚ö† RETRY`)
- Do not commit code
- Mark task as `[!]` in `ROADMAP.md`
- Log what was attempted and what failed in `GPTLOG.md`
- Optionally save test output as `test_results/TASK-###.log`

## üß™ Testing Protocol

1. **Use Only the VSCode Testing Explorer**  
   You must run tests using the built-in Testing Explorer panel in VSCode.  
   Do **not** invoke `pytest`, `unittest`, or test scripts via terminal commands like `python -m`.
   
   When automated tools are used (like GitHub Copilot), terminal commands that execute pytest may be used
   if the VS Code Testing Explorer cannot be directly accessed, but results should still be verified
   in the Testing Explorer whenever possible by the human operator.

2. **Detect All Tests**
   Tests are located under the `tests/` directory.  
   Ensure they are discovered automatically. Do **not** hardcode file paths.

3. **Run Full Suite**
   Always run **all tests** in the suite, not just the current file or module.

4. **Evaluate Results**
   - If all tests pass ‚Üí continue
   - If any test fails ‚Üí debug, fix the issue, and re-run until all tests pass
   - Never rollback unless explicitly instructed in the task or roadmap

5. **Recording Failures**
   - If you encounter persistent failures or reach a blocked state:
     - Mark the task as `[!]` in `ROADMAP.md`
     - Log full reasoning in `GPTLOG.md`
     - Save test output as `test_results/TASK-###.log`

6. **Do Not Bypass**
   - Do not skip or ignore failing tests
   - Do not alter test assertions unless explicitly told to
   - Do not assume success without verification from the Testing Explorer UI

---

## üîß Copilot Autonomy Protocol

1. **Proactive Command Execution**
   - Copilot should execute relevant commands without requiring explicit confirmation for each step
   - This includes running tests, Git operations, and file modifications
   - Copilot should provide clear explanations of what was done after execution

2. **Exceptions Requiring Confirmation**
   - Major architectural changes
   - Deletion of substantial code or files
   - Installation of new packages or dependencies
   - Operations that might incur costs or external API calls

3. **Secret Management**
   - Always verify .gitignore properly excludes secret files and directories before committing
   - Ensure no credentials, tokens, or API keys are committed to the repository
   - Double-check generated code to ensure it doesn't contain hardcoded secrets
   - Verify that all secret files are appropriately excluded from Git staging before commits

## üßæ File Format Standards

### ‚úÖ `ROADMAP.md`
```markdown
# Roadmap

- [x] TASK-001: Set up base project scaffold
- [~] TASK-002: Design scheduler class interface
- [ ] TASK-003: Implement scheduler logic
- [!] TASK-004: Timezone sync issue (blocked by merge logic)
```

### üß† `GPTLOG.md`
```markdown
## TASK-004
‚ö† RETRY  
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-03 16:02  
**Summary:**
- Attempted to sync calendar with merge logic
- Failing test: `test_event_merge_conflict`
- Possibly blocked by fallback rule design
```

### üìü `copilot_status.md`
```text
TASK-005
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üü° Reading ROADMAP.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Located TASK-005
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üõ†Ô∏è Editing scheduler.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Saved tests/test_conflicts.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Ran tests (PASS)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Committed TASK-005: Handle conflict overlap
```

### üì¶ `releases/TASK-###.md`
```markdown
# TASK-005

**Commit:** `TASK-005: Handle conflict overlap`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS  
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-03 16:37

## Summary
- Added conflict resolution to scheduler
- Tests written for overlapping time scenarios
- Validated in VSCode Testing Explorer
```

---

## üìì Logging Conventions

- One active task at a time
- `copilot_status.md` is reset on each task
- Logs are append-only ‚Äî never overwrite old entries
- Log files must be Markdown-compatible
- `TASK-###` must match across all files
- `test_results/*.log` only created if tests fail



---

## üå± Git Branching

For every task (`TASK-###`), Copilot must:

- Create and switch to a new branch named `task/TASK-###`
- Perform **all code, test, and logging work** on that branch
- Use the commit format `TASK-###: <summary>` as always
- Push the branch via `git push -u origin task/TASK-###`

Copilot must **not**:
- Push directly to `main`, `master`, or any protected branch
- Merge the task branch unless explicitly instructed in `ROADMAP.md` or by human override


---

## Structured Logging Protocol

### Syntax Overview

- `highlevel.<goal_id>` ‚Äì Defines a high-level objective or integration.
- `checkpoint.<checkpoint_id>` ‚Äì Marks a milestone under a high-level goal.
- `lowlevel.<task_id>` ‚Äì Specifies an actionable step under a checkpoint.
- `status: open | in-progress | complete | abandoned` ‚Äì Current state of the task.
- `note: <freeform natural language comment>` ‚Äì Optional context or explanation.

### Example Entry

```
highlevel.wa_integration
status: open
note: Add WhatsApp messaging support using Twilio.

checkpoint.twilio_auth
status: open
note: Handle Twilio API key validation.

lowlevel.write_twilio_auth_function
status: complete
note: Function implemented and tested in test_twilio_auth.py.
```

### Agent Behavior

- The agent must only append entries.
- The agent must resolve each `checkpoint.*` before proceeding to dependent `lowlevel.*`.
- Tasks should be logged chronologically under their logical hierarchy.

### Status Format in ROADMAP.md

The roadmap uses a lo-fi visual approach with color and format indicators:

- <span style="color: green;">Green text</span> with strikethrough - Completed items
- <span style="color: orange;">Orange text</span> with bold - In-progress items
- Regular text - Open/not started items
- <span style="background-color: orange; color: black;">Orange highlight with black text</span> - Currently active item

When updating the roadmap:

1. **Color coding:**
   - Completed items: `<span style="color: green;">~~item text~~</span>`
   - In-progress items: `<span style="color: orange;">**item text**</span>`
   - Open items: Regular text
   - Active item: `<span style="background-color: orange; color: black;">‚Üí item text</span>`

2. **Grouping:**
   - Group tasks by high-level items using section headings (`## Section Name`)
   - Keep one blank line between high-level groups

3. **When starting a new task:**
   - First, remove any previous amber highlighting from the roadmap by converting:
     `<span style="background-color: orange; color: black;">‚Üí item text</span>` to regular text
   - Then highlight the new active task with amber background and black text

4. **Before committing:**
   - Remove amber highlight from the active task in the roadmap
   - Convert it to appropriate status format (orange text if in-progress, regular if still open)
   - This prevents multiple highlighted items in the git history

### Example:
```
## Group Name
<span style="color: orange;">**highlevel.task_name**</span> status: in-progress note: Description.
<span style="color: green;">~~lowlevel.completed_task status: completed~~</span> note: Description.
<span style="background-color: orange; color: black;">‚Üí lowlevel.current_task status: open</span> note: Description.
lowlevel.future_task status: open note: Description.
```

## üîß Visual Roadmap Format Protocol (v2)

This project uses a structured ASCII-style visual format for `ROADMAP.md` to track high-level goals and nested tasks.

### üìê Format Structure

- **Section headers** use ASCII boxes:
  ```
  ====================================
  ||     Email & Calendar Tasks     ||
  ====================================
  ```

- **Nesting Hierarchy**
  - `highlevel.` goals ‚Üí left-aligned
  - `checkpoint.` ‚Üí prefixed with `‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ` or `‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ`
  - `lowlevel.` ‚Üí deeper indents using `‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ`, `‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ`, etc.

- **Coloring (using HTML):**
  - `<span style="color:limegreen">` = complete
  - `<span style="color:orange">` = in-progress
  - `<span style="color:red">` = open
  - `<span style="background-color:orange;color:black;font-weight:bold">` = current task highlight

- **Example Block:**
  ```
  üüß highlevel.verify_email_calendar status: in-progress
     note: Ensure core agents are stable.

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üüß checkpoint.test_email_agent status: in-progress
  ‚îÇ   note: Validate email behavior.
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üü© lowlevel.compare_email_mock_vs_real status: complete
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   note: Mocks match real agent formats.
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üü• lowlevel.test_email_edge_cases status: open
  ‚îÇ       note: Handle failures, retries.
  ```

- The agent should:
  - Always write new tasks in this format.
  - Update status by replacing the entire line of the task block.
  - Ensure only one task is highlighted at a time (`current`).
