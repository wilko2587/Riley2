# Calendar Agent Reasoning Tests Release Summary

## Branch: t110-calendar-reasoning

## Date: May 4, 2025

## Overview
This release implements a comprehensive suite of tests for the calendar agent's reasoning capabilities, with particular focus on verifying how the calendar handles complex multi-agent scheduling scenarios and boundary conditions.

## Completed Tasks

### Test Calendar Multi-Block Merge Across Boundary
- Implemented tests for detecting multi-day events when querying only part of their range
- Verified boundary detection at start and end dates of multi-day events
- Tested events that span across month boundaries
- Confirmed proper handling of overlapping multi-day events

### Test Calendar Double-Agent Scheduling Collision
- Implemented tests for concurrent scheduling of overlapping events
  - Verified that when two agents attempt to schedule overlapping events, conflicts are properly detected
  - Confirmed that the first successful operation blocks subsequent conflicting operations
  
- Implemented tests for priority-based conflict resolution
  - Added priority ranking system (high, medium, low)
  - Verified that higher priority events can override lower priority events
  - Confirmed equal priority events use first-come-first-served logic
  
- Implemented tests for reservation locking mechanics
  - Created comprehensive locking system to prevent race conditions
  - Tested acquiring and releasing locks
  - Verified overlapping slot locking prevention
  - Tested concurrent access to the same slot by multiple agents
  - Implemented automatic lock expiration with timeout
  - Verified complete reservation workflow from lock acquisition to finalization

## Files Added
- tests/reasoning/test_reservation_locking.py

## Files Modified
- ROADMAP.ansi

## Next Steps
The foundations for calendar agent testing are now in place. Future work should:
1. Build on these tests to implement more complex multi-agent scenarios
2. Integrate these tests with the real calendar implementation
3. Create more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies based on context and priority
