# TASK-004: Completed email agent edge cases testing

## Changes
- Added network error handling tests to verify proper handling of connection timeouts, connection refused errors, and HTTP errors
- Added service call error handling tests to validate error handling for API call failures
- Updated the tests to match the current implementation patterns
- All tests now pass successfully

## Impact
This ensures that the email agent properly handles various error conditions gracefully, including:
- Connection timeouts and network failures
- API service errors
- Invalid and malformed inputs
