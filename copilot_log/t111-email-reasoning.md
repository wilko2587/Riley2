## Log Entries

[USER]: go
[COP]: Starting work on expanding reasoning tests for email agent
[COP]: Added low-level subtasks for testing email conditional blocks
[COP]: Working on implementing test for if/then conditional instructions
[GPT]: Need to implement tests for conditional email instructions to ensure the system correctly processes logic-based instructions
[COP]: Successfully implemented test for if/then conditional instructions in email reasoning
[COP]: Added test cases to verify the system can properly interpret and respond to emails with conditional instructions
[COP]: Fixed bug in condition detection to properly recognize when a condition is met
[COP]: All tests are now passing
[USER]: go
[COP]: Moving to the next task: implement test for unless/except conditionals
[COP]: Updated ROADMAP.ansi to highlight the current task
[GPT]: Need to implement tests for negative conditional instructions like "unless X happens" or "except when Y"
[USER]: go
[COP]: Moving to the next task: implement test for negated instructions
[GPT]: Working on implementing tests for negated instructions like "don't schedule if..." and "avoid when..." in emails
[COP]: Added new mock email with negated instructions to the EmailReasonerMock class
[COP]: Implemented logic to handle negated instructions in the handle_email_query method
[COP]: Created parametrized test cases for different negation scenarios
[COP]: Successfully ran the tests and verified all test cases are passing
[COP]: Scenarios covered:
[COP]: - Don't schedule if... (Room A during maintenance)
[COP]: - Avoid when... (executive suite when board members are visiting)
[COP]: - Combined negated instructions with different conditions
