## Task: Implement test for concurrent scheduling of overlapping events

## Branch: t110-calendar-reasoning

## Timestamp: Sun, May  4, 2025 10:17:59 PM

[USER]: go
[COP]: Starting implementation of calendar agent reasoning tests for double-agent scheduling collision.

## Task: Implement test for priority-based conflict resolution

## Timestamp: Sun, May 4, 2025 11:30:45 PM

[USER]: go
[COP]: Beginning implementation of priority-based conflict resolution tests for the calendar agent. This will test whether the calendar correctly resolves conflicts based on event priority settings.

## Task: Implement test for reservation locking mechanics

## Timestamp: Sat, May 4, 2025 12:15:00 PM

[USER]: go
[COP]: Starting implementation of tests for calendar reservation locking mechanics. This will test the calendar's ability to lock timeslots during the scheduling process to prevent concurrent modification issues.
[GPT]: I'll implement a test suite that verifies the calendar agent's locking mechanism for reservations. This is important to ensure that when multiple agents try to book the same time slots, the system properly handles these concurrent requests and maintains data integrity.
