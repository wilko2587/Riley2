# Email Agent Conditional Logic Testing\n\n## Metadata\n- Branch name: t111-email-reasoning\n- Task name: Test email with embedded conditional blocks\n- Timestamp: 2025-05-05\n\n## Log Entries\n\n[USER]: go\n[COP]: Starting work on expanding reasoning tests for email agent\n[COP]: Added low-level subtasks for testing email conditional blocks\n[COP]: Working on implementing test for if/then conditional instructions\n[GPT]: Need to implement tests for conditional email instructions to ensure the system correctly processes logic-based instructions
[COP]: Successfully implemented test for if/then conditional instructions in email reasoning\n[COP]: Added test cases to verify the system can properly interpret and respond to emails with conditional instructions\n[COP]: Fixed bug in condition detection to properly recognize when a condition is met\n[COP]: All tests are now passing
