# üìù Riley2 Development Log

<!-- This file tracks development activities and progress over time -->

## May 3, 2025

### Session started
- Initialized development environment for Riley2
- Reviewed project structure and documentation
- Analyzed current ROADMAP.md status
- Current focus: `highlevel.verify_email_calendar` which is in progress
  - Sub-task: `checkpoint.test_email_agent` (in progress)
  - Working on: `lowlevel.compare_email_mock_vs_real`

### Analysis of email agent implementations
- Discovered structural differences between real and mock email agents:
  1. Real implementation uses standalone functions while mock uses a class-based approach
  2. Real implementation interfaces with Gmail API while mock uses test configuration data
  3. Real summarization uses LLM backend while mock uses hardcoded responses
- Need to create compatibility tests to ensure method signatures and output formats match

### Testing strategy
- The existing test_email_agent_compatibility.py contains tests to validate:
  1. Function existence in both implementations
  2. Signature compatibility for email_download_chunk
  3. Behavior consistency for email_filter_by_sender
  4. Output format compatibility for email_summarize_batch
  5. Overall result format consistency

### Implementation challenges
- The difference in implementation approach (class vs. standalone functions) creates potential compatibility issues
- Need to ensure tests validate that both implementations can be used interchangeably despite structural differences
- As per PROTOCOL.md, tests must be run using VS Code Testing Explorer, not via terminal commands

### Next steps
- Run tests using VS Code Testing Explorer as per PROTOCOL.md requirements
- Address any inconsistencies found during testing
- Update documentation accordingly

### Task Completion: lowlevel.compare_email_mock_vs_real
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-03 17:15
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Summary:**
- Successfully verified compatibility between real and mock email agent implementations
- Confirmed function existence, signature compatibility, and consistent output formats
- All tests passed in VS Code Testing Explorer
- Updated ROADMAP.md to mark the task as completed with appropriate status
- Updated PROTOCOL.md to clarify low-level task completion workflow
- Implemented new lo-fi log format for ROADMAP.md per requirements

### Task Completion: lowlevel.test_email_edge_cases
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-03 22:15
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Summary:**
- Created comprehensive test suite for email agent edge cases in tests/test_email_agent_edge_cases.py
- Implemented tests for invalid date formats, empty email batches, malformed data, and special characters
- Enhanced error handling in both mock and real email agent implementations:
  - Added proper error handling for invalid date formats in EmailAgentMock
  - Updated real email_download_chunk function to handle authentication errors gracefully
- Successfully verified all tests pass using VS Code Testing Explorer
- Updated ROADMAP.md to mark the task as complete
